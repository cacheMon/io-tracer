# Block I/O Events

**Description:** Captures block-level device I/O operations, providing insights into physical disk activity.

**Kernel Probes:** Attached via block layer instrumentation in the eBPF program.

## Data Captured

| # | Field | Type | Description |
|---|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Timestamp | `datetime` | Event timestamp (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.ffffff`) |
| 2 | PID | `u32` | Process ID that submitted the request |
| 3 | Command | `string` | Process name (max 16 characters) |
| 4 | Sector | `u64` | Starting sector number on disk (LBA) |
| 5 | Operation | `string` | Block operation type (see table below) |
| 6 | Size | `u64` | I/O size in bytes |
| 7 | Latency | `float` | Device latency in milliseconds (issue → completion) |
| 8 | TID | `u32` | Thread ID |
| 9 | CPU ID | `u32` | CPU where completion was processed |
| 10 | PPID | `u32` | Parent process ID |
| 11 | Device | `string` | Device number as `major:minor` identifying the partition/device |
| 12 | Queue Latency | `float` | Queue/scheduler latency in milliseconds (insert → issue); empty if unavailable |
| 13 | Command Flags | `string` | Pipe-separated REQ_* flags (e.g., `REQ_SYNC\|REQ_META`); empty if no flags set or on kernel ≥ 5.17 |
| 14 | Operation Code | `string` | Raw block operation code name (e.g., `REQ_OP_READ`, `REQ_OP_WRITE`); empty on kernel ≥ 5.17 |

> **Note:** Command Flags (field 13) and Operation Code (field 14) are only available on Linux kernel versions < 5.17. The `cmd_flags` field was removed from the `block_rq_complete` tracepoint in kernel 5.17+. On newer kernels (including 5.17, 6.x), these fields will always be empty. Use the Operation field (field 5) and RWBS flags to distinguish I/O types on newer kernels.

## Operation Types

Derived from the block layer `rwbs` string and normalized:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `read` | Read operation |
| `write` | Write operation |
| `discard` | Discard/TRIM operation |
| `flush` | Cache flush operation |
| `secure_erase` | Secure erase operation |
| `none` | No operation |

## Block Operation Codes (`REQ_OP_*`)

Raw operation codes from the kernel block layer:

| Code | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 0 | `REQ_OP_READ` | Read sectors from device |
| 1 | `REQ_OP_WRITE` | Write sectors to device |
| 2 | `REQ_OP_FLUSH` | Flush volatile write cache |
| 3 | `REQ_OP_DISCARD` | Discard/TRIM sectors |
| 5 | `REQ_OP_SECURE_ERASE` | Securely erase sectors |
| 6 | `REQ_OP_WRITE_SAME` | Write same data to multiple sectors |
| 7 | `REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND` | Append to zone (zoned devices) |
| 9 | `REQ_OP_WRITE_ZEROES` | Write zeroes to sectors |
| 10 | `REQ_OP_ZONE_OPEN` | Open a zone |
| 11 | `REQ_OP_ZONE_CLOSE` | Close a zone |
| 12 | `REQ_OP_ZONE_FINISH` | Finish a zone |
| 13 | `REQ_OP_ZONE_RESET` | Reset a zone |
| 15 | `REQ_OP_ZONE_RESET_ALL` | Reset all zones |
| 34 | `REQ_OP_DRV_IN` | Driver-specific input |
| 35 | `REQ_OP_DRV_OUT` | Driver-specific output |
| 36 | `REQ_OP_LAST` | Sentinel value |

These raw operation codes are captured in field 14 (Operation Code) on Linux kernels < 5.17 and provide the most accurate indication of the block layer operation type. On newer kernels, use field 5 (Operation) which derives the operation type from the rwbs string.

## Block Request Flags (`REQ_*`)

Command flags captured in the `Command Flags` field (field 13). Multiple flags are pipe-separated:

| Bit | Name | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `0x01` | `REQ_FAILFAST_DEV` | Fail fast on device error |
| `0x02` | `REQ_FAILFAST_TRANSPORT` | Fail fast on transport error |
| `0x04` | `REQ_FAILFAST_DRIVER` | Fail fast on driver error |
| `0x08` | `REQ_SYNC` | Synchronous request |
| `0x10` | `REQ_META` | Metadata I/O |
| `0x20` | `REQ_PRIO` | High priority request |
| `0x40` | `REQ_NOMERGE` | Do not merge with other requests |
| `0x80` | `REQ_IDLE` | Idle priority request |
| `0x100` | `REQ_INTEGRITY` | Data integrity protected |
| `0x200` | `REQ_FUA` | Force Unit Access (bypass write cache) |
| `0x400` | `REQ_PREFLUSH` | Flush cache before request |
| `0x800` | `REQ_RAHEAD` | Read-ahead request |
| `0x1000` | `REQ_BACKGROUND` | Background I/O |
| `0x2000` | `REQ_NOWAIT` | Don't wait if request cannot be issued |
| `0x4000` | `REQ_CGROUP_PUNT` | Cgroup accounting |

## RWBS Flags

Character flags from the block layer tracepoint `rwbs` string:

| Char | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `R` | READ | Read operation |
| `W` | WRITE | Write operation |
| `D` | DISCARD | Discard/TRIM |
| `E` | SECURE_ERASE | Secure erase |
| `F` | FLUSH | Cache flush |
| `N` | NONE | No operation |
| `S` | SYNC | Synchronous |
| `M` | META | Metadata |
| `A` | AHEAD | Read-ahead |
| `P` | PRIO | High priority |
| `B` | BARRIER | Barrier (legacy) |
